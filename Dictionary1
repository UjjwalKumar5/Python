# Copy the Dictionary
Numbers = {1:"One", 2:"Two", 3:"Three", 4:"Four", 5:"Five",}
Numbers1 = Numbers
# we cannot copy a Dictionary like this because if anything change in Numbers will automatically shows in Numbers1
# We have two methods for copy a Dictionary

Numbers2 = Numbers.copy() # one method

Numbers3 = dict(Numbers)  # Second method
